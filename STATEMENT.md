# Problem Description
 1.Managing personal spending is a common real-life challenge, especially for students who are just starting to track their expenses.  Financial data must be stored and arranged in an easy-to-understand project that makes use of fundamental Python concepts.

 2.The task is to write a program that can accurately record expenses, classify them, and display them to the user using only the fundamental Python features of loops, lists, dictionaries, and file handling.  A clean system for organized data storage, consistent formatting, and category-wise expense calculations is lacking in many basic programs.

 3.The solution is to develop a Python-based Expense Tracker that keeps track of expenses in a text file and enables users to view previously recorded expenses, add new entries, and view the total amount spent in each category.
 
 # Project Extent
The scope clearly defines what the Expense Tracker will and will not do.
**Within Scope (What the Project Will Do)**
Core Functionality: Record an expense with date, amount, category, and an optional note.
* Data Storage: Save all expenses in a local .txt file using simple file handling.
* Category Calculations: Compute total spending for each category using dictionaries.
* User Interface: Provide a basic Command-Line Interface (CLI) for user input and output.
* Basic Validation: Handle simple issues like empty files or missing data.
  
**Out of Scope (What the Project Won’t Do)**
* Advanced Financial Analysis: No charts, graphs, or budgeting algorithms.
* Database Storage: No use of SQL, CSV, or external databases.
* Graphical Interface: No GUI frameworks like Tkinter or PyQt.
* Multi-User Accounts: The program is intended for a single user at a time.

# Intended Audience
The project is designed for users who benefit from simple and clear implementation of core Python concepts:

College Evaluators / Instructors: Will assess how effectively the project implements file handling, loops, lists, dictionaries, and menu-driven logic.

Fellow Students / Beginners: Those looking for a clean, understandable example of a real-life application built using basic Python skills.

End Users: Anyone who wants a lightweight, offline tool to track daily personal expenses through a simple terminal interface.
